Design a controller for a four-wheel Omni-directional robot and verify it on a prototype. 
Project:
Omni-directional Robot controller design and verification on self-build prototype

## Objective: 
Learning how to design the controller for an Omni-directional Robot and implement it on a prototype regarding the simulation model. 

## Tasks description:
 1. Robot Controller Design: Use Matlab Robot Simulation (Mobile Robot Modeling)
 2. Omni-directional Robot Design: create 3D models with bill of material
 3. Build the prototype: assembly and test the prototype
 4. Test and verification: Apply the controller on the prototype and calibrate its configuration (write a test report)
Documentation: Write a report and post technical information on the project Githubs
