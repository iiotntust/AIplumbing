# The plumbing product development process applies artificial
This project introduces artificial intelligence technology into plumbing product development to improve overall processing efficiency and reduce personnel workload. 
# Project Description 
This project consists of Parts specification normalization, Picture-to-Picture matching (Machine Learning), and a database of plumbing parts. Parts specification normalization

## Objective: 
Learning how to design the controller for an omnidirectional robot and implement it on a prototype regarding the simulation model. 

## Tasks description:
 1. Robot Controller Design: Use Matlab Robot Simulation (Mobile Robot Modeling)
 2. Omni-directional Robot Design: create 3D models with the bill of material
 3. Build the prototype: assembly and test the prototype
 4. Test and verification: Apply the controller on the prototype and calibrate its configuration (write a test report)
Documentation: Write a report and post technical information on the project's GitHub
